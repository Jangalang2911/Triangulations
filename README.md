# Codebase of Professor Adrien Zakar's Triangulations Website

The goal of this project is to provide a visual display of entries from a database containing ancient Middle Eastern texts, maps, and atlases.

This project runs runs with a React frontend and calls python API's from our backend using FastAPI. We connect containers using Docker. 

Database can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1paVCh_yKpNbzHZPKrKu7ExZV4wZSK-J_4C6drFUqKYI/edit#gid=624471172).

## Notes

In the future, we have much to update on this project. There are currently tasks to complete in the `issues` tab of the project. The issues contain documentation and potential steps on how to tackle the tasks. This includes several bug fixes, filtering features, and data visualization features.

Also in the future, we want to publish and deploy the website to production, allowing anyone to gain access to and learn from the website.
